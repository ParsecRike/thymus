======

<p id="thymusDesc"><b>thymus.js</b> is a relatively small <a href="http://learn.jquery.com/plugins/">JQuery plug-in</a> that brings a view-centric 
framework/template engine to client browsers. Unlike typical JS-based MVC, MVVM or MVP frameworks, <b>thymus.js</b> concentrates it's efforts on 
simplicity and ease of use of stateless routes between a server and client via HTML5+ attributes. That translates into a more translucent behavior 
that does not try force an application into any particular framework's model/view observatory/binding methodology. In fact, <b>thymus.js</b> can 
potentially be used without a single line of JavaScript within an application. This lends itself to templating techniques where a server can provide 
a relatively infinite number of nested models/views of various formats (e.g HTML, XML, JSON, etc.) without being inundated with binding operations 
and maintaining model state. Every model/view route is JQuery selector driven. So, routing model data to multiple views is as simple as supplying 
the appropriate JQuery selector. The possibilities are only limited by query capabilities (and your own imagination and creativity ;)</p> See

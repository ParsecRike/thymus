<p id="thymusDesc"><b>thymus.js</b> is a small (<b>&lt; 5k minified</b>) <a href="http://learn.jquery.com/plugins/">JQuery plug-in</a> that brings a 
controller-centric template engine to client browsers. Unlike typical JS-based MVC frameworks, <b>thymus.js</b> concentrates it's efforts on simplicity 
and ease of use of the controller. That translates into a more translucent behavior that does not try force an application into any particular 
framework's model/view methodology. Instead of dictating how views need to be defined and/or how interaction between them takes place, <b>thymus.js</b> 
simply provides a flexible means to coordinate the transfer of data/views between the client and server. This lends itself to templating techniques 
where a server can provide a relatively infinite number of nested models/views of various formats (e.g HTML, XML, JSON, etc.). Views can be 
pre-processed and include model data within a returned HTML fragment and/or provide an initial view for model/data inclusion at a later time. Every 
model/view transition is JQuery selector driven. So, the possibilities are only limited by query capabilities (and your own imagination and creativity 
;)</p> See <a href="http://ugate.github.io/thymus/">http://ugate.github.io/thymus/</a> for documentation/demos/examples.

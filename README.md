<p id="thymusDesc"><b>thymus.js</b> is a front-end MQV (Model Query View) framework that aims to accelerate and simplify web development. 
Instead of applying typical JS-based MVC, MVVM or MVP concepts, <b>thymus.js</b> concentrates its efforts on simplicity and ease of use of 
models/routes that are constructed on the fly using standard DOM selectors defined within HTML5+ attributes. Thus, reducing model/controller 
redundancy on the client. That translates into a more translucent behavior that does not try force an application into any particular 
model/view observatory/binding methodology. In fact, <b>thymus.js</b> can potentially be <b>used without a single line of JavaScript (within an 
application)</b>. This lends itself to templating techniques where a server can provide a relatively infinite number of nested models/views of 
various formats (e.g. HTML, XML, JSON, etc.) without being inundated with binding operations and maintaining model state. The possibilities 
are limited only by your own imagination, creativity and query capabilities.</p> See <a href="http://thymusjs.org">http://thymusjs.org</a> for
